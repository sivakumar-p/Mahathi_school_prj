  Red fox can be found in eastern canada , they got their name. 
The red fox is the largest of the true foxes and one of the most 
widely distributed members of the order carnivorous, being present across the entire Northern 
Hemisphere including most of North America, Europe and Asia, plus parts of North Africa . Due to its
 presence in Australia, it is included on the list of the ¨ World's 100 worst invasive species .¨The red fox
 is a species of fox in the family Canidae. It is also called the common fox. Its scientific 
 name is Vulpes vulpes. or dog family, although they aren't as social as some of their cousins, typically hunting alone.
 They're medium-sized, between 7 and 15 pounds, with pointy faces, lithe frames, and bushy tails. But unlike their relatives, 
 foxes are not pack animals.As cousins to wolves and dogs, foxes are a great model for dog domestication. They diverged 
 from the wolf lineage about 12 million years ago a brief time period, evolutionarily. It is difficult to study the process 
 of the dog's domestication since its wild relatives, the fox and wolf, are now different species.Although red foxes are part 
 of the Canidae family along with dogs, they have more in common with cats. Here are just a few similarities: Like cats,
 red foxes are most active at night. Red fox symbolism is akin to the sun, so we're talking about: Radiance, Energy, Passion.
