  The snowshoe hare is also  called  the varying hare or snowshoe rabbit.they are species of hare found in North America. 
  It has the name "snowshoe" because of the large size of its hind feet. The animal's feet prevent it from sinking into the 
  snow when it hops and walks. Its feet also have fur on the soles to protect it from freezing temperatures.They came from the
  continent of north america .The snowshoe hare are well adapted for their life in the north. They have large, furry feet that
  act as snowshoes for traveling on top of the snow. Their fur is thick to protect them from freezing temperatures. 
  It also turns white in winter so that they are almost invisible in a snowy background. The snowshoe hare can run 60 
  kilometer per an hour. Snowshoe hare does eat meat, and they don't seem all that picky about what kind of animal it comes f
  rom. ... While it's already known in the scientific community that some herbivores occasionally indulge in meat-eating, what 
  surprised Peers was that the hares scavenged "quite frequently and for long periods of time." Despite their larger size, hares
  are not more dangerous than rabbits. As a rule, they're just as gentle and docile. Like rabbits, though, they'll bite if they 
  feel threatened.
