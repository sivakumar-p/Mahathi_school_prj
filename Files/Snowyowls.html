 The snowy owl is a large, white owl of the true owl family. It is sometimes also referred to, more infrequently,
 as the polar owl, the white owl and the Arctic owl. The bristle on their beak helps them sense objects nearby, also Their 
 feet are covered with feathers like fluffy slippers. Snowy owls can live for 10 years or more in the wild and 28 years in 
 captivity. They are quite round-bodied, which helps them maintain their body heat, and they have thick plumage. 
 As far as natural predators go, only a handful of animals hunt Snowy Owls. usually foxes and wolves hunt them, but this 
 occurs mostly when the owls are vulnerable sitting on or near the nest. Some eagle gulls will also try to take the eggs and
 young out of a Snowy Owl. Snowy owls are one of the only owls that have the advantage to hunt through day and night, they 
 especially hunt in day time when it is summer science the days are long. Snowy owls have a great Eye site as well as hearing. 
 Owls are known as silent predators of the night, capable of flying just inches from their prey without being detected. They 
 can see clearly about eight times as far as humans can, allowing them to spot and focus in on a rabbit or other animal at a 
 distance of about two miles. The white owl symbolizes wisdom with the snowy owl representing endurance. It leads to big dreams
 and confidence in pursuing them. They can be found in the continent of North pole but when it is not breeding season they can
