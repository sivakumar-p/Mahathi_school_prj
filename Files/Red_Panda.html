  Red pandas live in the Eastern Himalayas and South-western China. They are mainly 
  Active at night and they tend to look for food at dawn and at dusk, and have a diet that is 
  97% of bamboo and they occasionally eat small mammals, eggs and flowers. Red pandas live up to 
  14 years on average. They are endangered mainly because of their natural habitat being destroyed
  and also due to them being hunted.Red pandas are the only species remaining in their taxonomic family ,
  a living relic of the past. Saving them is important to the preservation of the world's natural heritage and 
  global biodiversity. Red pandas have two extinct relatives. There is an effect called the Red panda 
  effect, If you're expecting to see a red panda, you see a red panda, even if it's just a dirty raccoon . 
  Red Pandas are known as the escape artist.Cubs' eyes and ears are sealed until they are around 2 to 3 weeks
  of age. They nurse until they are 13 to 22 weeks old. They stay with their mothers in their birthing dens for 
  about 90 days and reach maturity at 18 to 20 months.They have an extended wrist bone which has developed over time 
  to help them climb trees and eat bamboo.The red panda was first classified and given its scientific name, Ailurus fulgens, 
  in 1825. Giant pandas were described much later and earned their "panda" name because of the similarities the two species
  shared, like eating bamboo. They are commonly found in China , Nepal and Bhutan.
